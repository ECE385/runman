2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_100 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_100 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_100]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_100 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_100]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#1 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of -3.278 ns between clk_wiz/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and ila/inst/ila_core_inst/shifted_data_in_reg[7][0]_srl8/D (clocked by clk_100) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -3.905 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#2 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 6.746 ns between clk_wiz/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and ila/inst/ila_core_inst/u_trig/U_TM/N_DDR_MODE.G_NMU[0].U_M/allx_typeA_match_detection.ltlib_v1_0_0_allx_typeA_inst/probeDelay1_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_100) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -3.448 ns.
